# Welcome to your CDK Go project!

This is a blank project for CDK development with Go.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `go test`         run unit tests

 ## Build
 * `make build` will build the app
   * may need to use the -B argument if make thinks the build target is up to date
